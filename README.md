# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Welcome to my Webpage I designed using information leaerned from Lecture 0 and Lecture 1 of the CS50 course.
I used HTML,CSS,Sass and Bootstrap4.

This is a screen-reponsive website.

It has a Title, 3 pictures, an unordered list and a table.
The table consists of different species of Dogs, you can also click on the links that would forward you to a Wikipedia Page to learn more about those species.

I used Bootstrap4 to create a hover table.

Thank You so much for visiting my website
